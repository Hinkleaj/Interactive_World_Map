# Interactive_World_Map
This map was my final project for Fab Academy. Everything you want to know about it is in the [WorldMap.html](WorldMap.html) file. Apparently GitLab Pages allows you to host static HTML websites directly from your GitLab repository. This should allow it to be rendered as a website in the Github viewer.
